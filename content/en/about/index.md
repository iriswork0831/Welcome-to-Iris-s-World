Hello! I'm Iris Wang. I am an AI/ML Solution Architect driven by deep curiosity and a passion for transforming complex problems into elegant, human-centered solutions. With a background in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Management Analytics (4.0 GPA) from McGill University, I bring both technical precision and creative vision to every project I undertake.

I thrive at the intersection of data, design, and empathy — combining rigorous analytical thinking with a genuine understanding of user needs. My work spans from developing LLM-powered healthcare tools for aphasia patients to building scalable data-driven systems and predictive models that bridge technology and impact.

Recognized for being a fast learner, sharp problem-solver, and compassionate collaborator, I am committed to leveraging AI responsibly to build systems that not only perform intelligently but also serve meaningfully.
