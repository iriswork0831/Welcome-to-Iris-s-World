<div class="text-start">
I was born and raised in Shanghai, China, where curiosity was part of everyday life.  <br>

A full scholarship brought me to Vancouver for an exchange program — a city full of greenery and rain. I soon realized I wasn’t built for endless cloudy days, so I moved to Montreal to study at McGill University, where I found both challenge and clarity.    <br>


I’ve always loved **trying new things** — from exploring different fields of study to discovering the joy of snowboarding, where I earned my **CASI Level 1 certificate** after my very first season. I see every new skill as a small experiment in growth.    <br>


With the help of large language models (LLMs), I began to see how the knowledge I’ve built — in mathematics, computer science, and analytics — can truly **help people solve real problems**. That realization led me toward becoming a **Solution Architect**, someone who connects technology with human needs.    <br>


I don’t limit myself. I’m **always ready for new challenges**, open to opportunities, learning, and exposure.  <br>

"If there's one thing that will always make me happy, that's learning. "

# My Journey
{.text-center}

## Background
I'm currently exploring opportunities in AI/ML, with experience in multiple fields including Medical and Consulting 

## What Drives Me
I'm driven by the challenge of utilizing AI and machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems and help people. My curiosity makes me a fast learner and constantly pushes me to explore how data, empathy, and logic intersect — turning complex problems into clear, impactful solutions. I believe AI should empower people and make technology feel human.
