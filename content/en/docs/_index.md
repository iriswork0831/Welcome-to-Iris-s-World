This section showcases my work as a software developer - all the projects, 
technologies, and solutions I've built. Each project demonstrates different 
aspects of my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.

Browse through the different categories to learn more about my experience with 
web development, data analysis, APIs, and more. Each project includes 
technical details, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

Other content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates
should live in the [About](/about/) and [Community](/community/) pages.

Content](https://docsy.dev/docs/best-practices/organizing-content/).
